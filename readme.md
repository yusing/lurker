### lurker

lurker is a selfhostable, read-only reddit client. it is
better than old-reddit because:

- it renders well on mobile
- it respects `prefers-color-scheme`
- no account necessary to subscribe to subreddits
- no account necessary for over-18 content

i host a version for myself and a few friends. reach out to
me if you would like an invite. 

### features

- minimal use of client-side javascript
- account-based subscription system
- pagination
- invite-only user management
- comment collapsing, jump-to-next/prev comment
- "search on undelete" url for deleted comments
- over-18, spoiler images are hidden by default

i use lurker daily, and above features are pretty good for
my use. i do not intend to add much more, i dont like
writing js.

### setup

you can run lurker as a systemd service on nixos:

```
inputs.lurker.url= "git+https://git.peppe.rs/web/lurker";
  .
  .
  .
services.lurker = {
  enable = true;
  port = 9495;
};
```

for non-nixos users:

```
bun run src/index.js 
```

### usage

the instance is open to registrations when first started.
you can head to /register and create an account. this
account will be an admin account. you can click on your
username at the top-right to view the dashboard and to
invite other users to your instance. copy the link and send
it to your friends!

### technical

lurker uses an sqlite db to store accounts, invites and
subscriptions. it creates `lurker.db` in the current
directory. there is no way to configure this right now.

to hack on lurker:

```
nix shell .#        # get a devshell
nix build .#lurker  # build the thing
```
